<a id="c_springConstraints"></a>

## Constraints unique to compression springs:    

#### Slenderness 
Slenderness is a compression spring's ratio of free length (L\_Free) to 
mean coil diameter (Mean\_Dia). 
If this ratio exceeds 4 for a compression spring, that spring will have a 
tendency to buckle under load. 
In that case, the spring will usually need support in the form of 
a sleeve or post. 
In order to restrain the search to select designs that do not have a tendency to buckle, 
set the value of Slenderness MAX to a value of 4.0 or less. 

For additional information, see: [Buckling](c_spring.html#c_springBuckling) 

#### %\_Avail\_Deflect 
%\_Avail\_Deflect is the percentage of available deflection consumed at load point 2. 
%\_Avail\_Deflect is usually constrained to be less than 85 to 98 percent. 
Thus, it requires the search to select designs that provide a small margin 
between load point 2 and the solid condition.

<a id="c_springEndTypes"></a>  
___

## End Types 

ODOP:Spring currently implements six spring end types for compression springs. 
In addition, the user can define specialized end conditions. 
These end types are represented by the Calculation Input End\_Type which 
for compression springs has the following possible values: 

          Compression 
    
    1     Open    
    2     Open&Ground   
    3     Closed   
    4     Closed&Ground  
    5     Tapered_C&G  
    6     Pig-Tail
    7     User_Specified  

For a compression spring, the end type selection directly impacts the value of
Inactive\_Coils and Add\_Coils@Solid. 
L\_Solid, Pitch and other variables are impacted indirectly. 

<!--- Additional information may be found in the documentation sections for EQNSET.  -->

When End\_Type is set to one of the standard (non User_Specified) selections, 
Inactive\_Coils and Add\_Coils@Solid will be set by the 
program from values contained in internal tables. 
When the value of End\_Type is User_Specified, 
the user may set these values by making an entry in the corresponding 
numeric entry field. 

#### Add_Coils@Solid 
In order to facilitate the treatment of less common compression spring end 
types such as the "Tapered, Closed and Ground" configuration associated with hot 
wound springs, ODOP:Spring has added an extra term into the solid height 
calculation. 
Add\_Coils@Solid is a constant that is normally determined by 
the value of End\_Type. 
It is used to separate the solid height calculation from the rate equation which 
is dependent on the value of Inactive\_Coils. 
Add\_Coils@Solid represents the number of wire diameters added into the solid 
height beyond Coils\_T. 
For Open and Closed end types, it has a value of +1.0. 
For Open&Ground and Closed&Ground end types, it has a value of 0.0. 
For the Tapered\_C&G end type, Add\_Coils@Solid has a value of -0.5. 

Note that the Add\_Coils@Solid term is not included in Coils\_T or the wire 
length and weight calculations. 
It is only an adjustment for the solid height calculation and is not the 
correct way to represent dead coils. 

The Add_Coils@Solid term may be used to represent unusual end configurations. 
For example, springs that have a different end type at each end. 
To establish the value of Inactive\_Coils and/or Add_Coils@Solid directly, 
first select a value of End\_Type of User_Specified. 

Examples:  
To represent a spring with one end Closed 
and with the other end Closed&Ground: 

    CHANGE  End_Type  User_Specified
    CHANGE  Inactive_Coils   2.0
    CHANGE  Add_Coils@Solid  0.5

To represent a spring with ten active coils, two dead coils and closed ends: 

    CHANGE  End_Type  User_Specified
    FIX Coils_T     14.0
    CHANGE  Inactive_Coils   4.0
    CHANGE  Add_Coils@Solid  1.0

<a id="c_springBuckling"></a>

## Buckling 

A compression spring intended for operation without lateral support 
should have a ratio of free length to coil diameter (Slenderness) less 
than approximately 4 to avoid buckling. 
For designs with a greater Slenderness ratio, lateral support is usually 
provided by operation in a sleeve or over a post. 


                     free length          L_Free
    Slenderness = ----------------  =  -------------
                    coil diameter        Mean_Dia

The constraint Slenderness MAX can be used to restrict the search to 
designs that will not tend to buckle. 
Note that Slenderness is not constrained in the default startup design. 
Thus, unless this constraint is established, 
a search may produce designs that are subject to buckling. 

The Report tabs will provide an indication as to the possibility of 
bucking for each specific design and loading condition. 
Both the fixed-free and fixed-fixed end conditions are covered.

More precise treatments of this subject are available in the resources listed 
in the [Spring Design References](/docs/Help/SpringDesign/references.html) section 
of the documentation.
