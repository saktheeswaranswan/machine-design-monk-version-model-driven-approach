# Torsion Spring Design Type

The Torsion Spring design type is a full-featured mathematical model enabling 
the engineering design of round wire helical coil torsion springs. 

This section presents material unique to the Torsion Spring design type. 
The more general material available at [Spring Design Topics](/docs/Help/SpringDesign) 
provides important supplemental information.

## End Types   

For torsion springs, the Calculation Input End_Type has the following possible values: 

         Torsion   
         
    1    Tangent
    2    User_Specified

In the current version of ODOP:Spring, no calculations depend on these End_Type settings. 
They are for display only. 

Separately, the values of Arm\_1, Arm\_2, L\_End\_1, L\_End\_2, XLen\_1 and XLen_2 are available to 
describe end conditions. 
This diagram may be helpful.

While single line comments work as expected, 
the previous version of Eclipse required a multi-line comment must be the last thing in the file. 
Eclipse .md Preview suppressed display of everything after the comment header.
